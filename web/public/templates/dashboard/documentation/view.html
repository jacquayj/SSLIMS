					<h2>Introduction</h2>

					<p>Welcome to the Sanger Sequencing Laboratory Information Management System (SSLIMS) documentation. In this document you'll find information explaining what SSLIMS is, and how to use the system with ease and efficiency. Read on to learn more.</p>

					<p>SSLIMS is a laboratory information management system written by John Jacquay and the Cyberinfrastructure section at the University of Florida's Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR). The purpose of SSLIMS is to provide an easy to use, mobile, and cross platform laboratory data management application for ICBR's Sanger Sequencing lab staff, managers, and customers. SSLIMS is an aggregation of multiple software pieces that work together to form a comprehensive solution. A few of these "pieces" include the SSLIMS web interface, instrument data sync client (an application that runs on the instrument workstations), and the REST API which is only notable for developers. These distinct pieces will be described in depth in the subsequent sections.</p>

					<p>SSLIMS also communicates with the external application "iLab". iLab serves as the standard web interface for customers to submit requests at ICBR. Customers needing to submit DNA sequencing requests to the Sanger core follow this procedure:</p>
					
					<div class="doc-img">
						iLab Integration &amp; Application Roles<br />
						<img src="/images/docs/sslims-ilab.png" />
					</div>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Login to iLab</li>
						<li>Select the Sanger Sequencing core</li>
						<li>Complete the standard sequencing request form</li>
						<li>Provide billing information</li>
					</ul>

					<p>From this point SSLIMS takes over by downloading the customer's request via the iLab API, and alerts the Sanger lab staff of the incoming request. The lab staff, using SSLIMS, process the customer's request and deliver the resulting data. As progress is made by the lab staff, milestones existing in iLab are updated by SSLIMS. To summarize: iLab handles customer request submission and billing, and SSLIMS handles everything else up to data delivery.</p>

					<br /><br />
					<h3>Getting Help &amp; Submitting Feedback</h3>

					<div class="doc-img">
						Help/Feedback Icon<br />
						<img src="/images/docs/contact-icon.png" />
					</div>

					<p>If you encounter an issues, bugs, or just need help while using SSLIMS, simply click the mail icon at the bottom right corner of your browser. A dialog will appear where you can provide the details of your question or issue. You can specify the urgency of your request using the "Importance" select box, and preference for the type of response. A member of Cyberinfrastructure can respond via email, phone, or in person with a visit to the Sanger lab.</p> 


					<br /><br />
					<h3>Sorting &amp; Filtering of Data Tables</h3>

					<div class="doc-img">
						Data Table<br />
						<img src="/images/docs/data-table.png" style="height:230px;" />
					</div>

					<p>Throughout the SSLIMS web interface, you'll notice consistent use of table design that is used to view, search, and filter data. These tables are generic, so the functionality between them are identical. Note that any change to the table view (sort, filter, page, etc..) will be saved and recalled next time the page is loaded on the same device/browser. These saved "states" are specific to the device/browser, and won't propagate to other devices (even if you use the same account).</p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Viewing Data:</strong> You can view multiple pages of data by clicking the page number near the bottom right corner of the table, or by clicking the "Next" or "Previous" buttons that sit to the right and left of the page number list.</li>
						<li><strong>Sorting:</strong> You can sort any column by clicking the column label.</li>
						<li><strong>Filtering:</strong> You can search/filter data tables by typing in the search box located at the bottom left corner of the table. The table will update as you type, and even search fields that aren't visible in the table but still relate to the record.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Sequencing Requests</h2>

						Request Received PDF<br />
						<img src="/images/docs/request-pdf.png" style="height: 320px;margin-top:0;" />
					</div>

					<p>Sequencing requests are submitted by customers via the iLab website. These requests are subsequently imported into SSLIMS. This is done automatically, and the import takes less than a minute after the request status is changed to "processing", "financials_approved", or "researcher_in_agreement". Only requests of the "DNA Sequencing Request" type that belong to "ICBR Sanger Sequencing" core will be imported. A pop up notification will appear in SSLIMS for staff and managers when a new request is imported.</p>

					<p>Once a sequencing request is imported into SSLIMS, an email is sent to the customer at the address specified in the iLab "DNA Sequencing Request" form data delivery fields (This email address will be used in SSLIMS for all subsequent communications such as important lab news, alerts, and data delivery relating to the customer's request). This email has a PDF attached which contains request information, sample information, a gel photo, and a QR code that can be scanned by staff to check the requests samples in. While requests are imported as soon as they are detected, a core manager or staff member must press the "Begin" button on the request in iLab for the requests samples to be available for check-in.</p>

					<h3>Viewing Sequencing Requests</h3>

					<div class="doc-img">
						Sequencing Requests<br />
						<img src="/images/docs/data-table.png" style="height:230px;" />
					</div>

					<p>
						You can view sequencing requests in a few different ways:

						<ul>
							<li>By clicking the pop up alert that appears when the request is imported.</li>
							<li>By clicking the <a href="#requests">View Requests</a> tab in the left-hand navigation, then click the name of the request that you'd like to view.</li>
							<li>By clicking the then click the name of the request that you'd like to view in the Recent Requests section on the <a href="#dashboard">main dashboard page</a>.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<br /><br />
					<h3>Checking In Request Samples</h3>

					<p>When a customer brings their request samples into the lab, they must be checked into SSLIMS. This can be achieved by clicking the <a href="#samples/checkin">Check-in Sample</a> link in the left-hand navigation. If the customer brings in the request PDF (that they were emailed) with their samples, you can use the built-in QR scanner to quickly find their request. Otherwise, click the <a href="#samples/checkin/via-search">By Search</a> tab to manually search for the request.</p>

					<p>You can search by request name (e.g. ICBR-SS-35), customer name, customer email, or request type. When you find the applicable request, simply click the check box next to the request to select it, then click either of the Check-in buttons (depending on whether you need to check-in a few samples, or every sample in the request). Now that you have checked in the customer's samples, you are able to add them to a new sample sheet for sequencing.</p>

					<h2>Sample Sheets</h2>

					<p>Once you have checked in customer samples, you are ready to create a sample sheet for use in one of the sequencers. Samples must have a status of "Received, ready to load" to be eligible for use in a sample sheet. If a sample has already been added to a sheet, the status will be "Loaded, ready for sequencing" which prevents the sample from being added to a new sample sheet (The sample won't be listed in the data table when creating a new sheet).</p>

					<p>You are able to remove samples from an existing sheet, so the sample is eligible for use in a new sheet. This can be done by navigating to the request which contains the samples, marking the check box next to the applicable samples, and clicking the "Remove From Sheet" button below the "Unproccessed Samples" data table. This simply resets the sample(s) status back to "Received, ready to load", and doesn't actually remove the sample from any existing sheets.</p>

					<p>The same process applies to samples with a status of "Sequencing complete", except the sample will appear in the "Sequenced Samples" data table and the button will be labeled "Rerun Sample". Again, this won't affect any runs that have already been uploaded for that sample, it simply changes the sample's status.</p>

					<h3>Creating Sample Sheets</h3>

					<p>To create a new sample sheet, click the "Create Sheet" link in the left-hand navigation. You will see an image of the physical plate used in the instrumentation to the left of the page, and the samples that are eligible to load to the right (Unless you use an iPad or device with a small screen size, in which case the two sections will be stacked vertically.)</p>

					<p>There are two ways to load samples onto the new sheet. The first method uses the automated "Autoload Sample" section located beneath the plate image. Simple choose the loading protocol (horizontal or vertical) and the desired starting well index, then click the "Load Samples" button. This will automatically load all eligible samples displayed in the "Samples Ready To Load" data table either vertically or horizontally starting with the well index you specified. You will see the wells turn blue on the pate if a sample is currently loaded.</p>

					<p>You can also drag and drop samples from the "Samples Ready To Load" or "Control Samples" table into a well using your mouse or touchscreen. This method can also be used to rearrange and reorder samples that are currently loaded. To view information about a sample currently in a well, click or touch the blue well to view a popup with sample details. Using this popup, you can navigate to the full sample detail page, or remove the sample from the sheet and queue it back into the "Samples Ready To Load" table.</p>

					<p>In the "Sample Sheet Info" section you will see two fields, one to give the sample sheet a name (which defaults to the current date), and the other to change the sample sheet's instrument configuration profile. Instrument configuration profiles consist of numerous settings used by the instrument. These include: Application, Plate Sealing, Result Group, Instrument Protocol, and Analysis Protocol. The Application and Plate Sealing options are a global sheet setting, and don't apply to individual samples. Result Group, Instrument Protocol, and Analysis Protocol can/do apply to individual samples. The two groups of settings are combined into a single "Instrument Configuration Profile" for convenience.</p>

					<p>The instrument configuration drop down specifies the group of instrument settings that will be applied to the sheet and all samples contained within that sheet. You can change the configuration on a per sample basis if needed by clicking the "Edit" link next to the "Config" line in the sample's pop up view. Note that only the Result Group, Instrument Protocol, and Analysis Protocol settings are the only options that can changed when specifying a configuration per sample, and changing a sample's configuration has no effect on the sheet's global instrument configuration or other samples in the sheet.</p>

					<p>When you're finished adding samples to the sheet and have verified that all of the sheet's settings are correct, click the "Create Sheet" button to save your changes.</p>

					<h3>Editing Sample Sheets</h3>

					<p>If you made a mistake or need to change the configuration of an existing sheet, simply press the "Edit" button located at the bottom of the sheet detail page. When editing sheets, you can only rearrange or remove samples previously added to that sheet during creation. No new/additional samples can be added to the sheet, even if their status is "Received, ready to load".</p>

					<p>When you're finished editing a sheet, click the "Save Changes" button to commit your changes.</p>
